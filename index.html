 <h1> The cost of incarceration in New York City</h1>
 <h2> New York City Mayor Eric Adams has called for a five per cent cut across all public services in response to what he refers to as a "migrant crisis." But experts and advocates alike believe most savings can be made by rethinking the cost of incarceration.</h2>

<p> In 2021, the New York City Comptroller revealed the cost of incarceration has grown to more than $556,000 per person each year. That's over $1,500 each day to lock up just one person. The Comptroller's findings show New York City "is spending more and more to incarcerate fewer and fewer individuals."</p>

  <p> The analysis shows a 15 per cent decline in the average number of incarcerated individuals in New York City between 2011 and 2021. But during the same time period, the cost of incarceration quadrupled from $395 per day to $1,525.</p>

    <p> Data from the Comptroller shows the number of people detained on Rikers Island has increased to nearly 6,200 people year-over-year as of Aug. 1. Of those, more than 85 per cent of those detained are awaiting trial and have yet to be convicted of a crime.</p>

    <p> Tentatively set to close in 2027, conditions on Rikers Island have been described by the Nunez Independent Monitor as "disturbing," with a record number of people dying in custody in 2022. </p>

    <p> "Real people are experiencing real trauma and pain and, in some cases, are suffering irreparable injuries and death," a July report from the Nunez Independent Monitor reads. </p>

    <p>In 2021, more than half (53 per cent) of people facing incarceration had previously been diagnosed with a mental illness, up from 32 per cent in 2011. Meanwhile, use of force rates by correctional officers increased dramatically, from 178 incidents per 1,000 average daily population in 2011 to 1,561 in 2021.</p>

    <p> More than half of those who are incarcerated on Rikers Island — 56 per cent — are Black, according to the New York City Department of Corrections, despite making up less than 25 per cent of the city’s population.</p>

    <p>Mayor Adams has called for more than $100 billion in funding for the Department of Correction (DoC) in 2024. However, experts at the Vera Institute of Justice are warning that incarceration does not make society safer. In fact, at least 36 people have died in DoC custody since 2021.</p>
